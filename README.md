My name is **Yu Zhang** ([jy tÊƒÉ‘Å‹], **å¼µå®‡**/**å¼ å®‡** in traditional/simplified Chinese).

I am currently a third-year PhD student at HLT@SUDA, advised by Prof. Guohong Fu. I expect to graduate in 2025. Prior to this, I received my M. Eng. degree from Soochow University in 2021.

My early research focused on structured prediction tasks, specifically dependency parsing and constituency parsing. Currently, my research interests have evolved to focus on developing efficient text generation models. I am particularly intrigued by the prospect of developing hardware-efficient methods for linear-time sequence modeling. As a disciple of parallel programming, I am passionate about exploring techniques that harness the power of parallel computing to develop scalable subquadratic models.
